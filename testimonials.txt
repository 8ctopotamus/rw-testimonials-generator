<blockquote>"Confirming my belief that many baby boomers have the means to redirect their monies and it can be done to help them with their Long Term Care.  Many need help in preparing for when and not if a health crises hits.  Will they have enough money to ride the storm?  Most will not even with the careful savings and investing they have done through the years.  I know when I have talked to many over the age of 65 they do not have any LTC plan or investment in effect. I have asked the owner of the agency to start looking into assisting his clients with LTC and investments but his focus has been on Property and Casualty.  I am going to assertively talk to him about broadening his business by including more LTC investments since he is licensed to do so. I think Don did a great job and is very knowledgeable.  I knew instinctively that the agency I work for is missing the boat on this opportunity and want to pursue a more active role in introducing our clients to a better way to help them have their money out live them." -Scott Astrosky</blockquote>
